This is a monorepo.

The ***real README*** you usually want to read is [the README of time-analytics-webpack-plugin package](./packages/time-analytics-webpack-plugin/).

## Q&A

1. why monorepo? Why test is in a packge?

This repo is pretty easy, then why it is a monorepo?

The main purpose is to test the source code just like the real environment.

The plugin is kind of special, because it hacks many things. So it is subtle to only test logic, and it would be more confident to use it if it's tested in a real environment.

And there are some other benefits, .e.g, the type will not pollute other repos.
